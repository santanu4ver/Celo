### A Few Thoughts
Once started as weekends' experiment, Celo is now v3.0.0. The development is through enough updates I think its best time to let it go, and be it open sourced. It's possible that I may not be available to update the repo frequently in future, encouraging you to play with the codes if you needs any modification; I might chime in at sometime if any critical error(s), though. Thank you!

## How the Locker Works
The application divides into three-four stages:
- Camouflage - A basic game (2018)
- Login - Opens upon a key-press combination
- Locker Area - Opens the personal space to store your items (opens differently between legit and unexpected guests)
- Return to Camouflage - Works immediately upon key-press at any time

Following are visuals from different sections to depict the functionalities:
